# MNIST Predictions with Neural Networks
This project aims to build and train a neural network model to accurately predict handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset, which stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, is a large collection of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, MNISTPredictionsWithNN.ipynb, detailing the entire process from loading the data, preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks in recognizing and predicting handwritten digits. By leveraging the MNIST dataset, this project explores the capabilities of deep learning models to perform image classification tasks with high accuracy.

# Features
Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the MNIST dataset to understand its structure and composition.
Data Preprocessing: Preparation of the dataset for training, including normalization and reshaping of images.
Model Building: Construction of a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Model Training: Training the model on the MNIST dataset with appropriate hyperparameters.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss, and visualizing predictions on test images.
Insights: Discussion of the results, including potential areas for improvement and further exploration.
# Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for the project.
